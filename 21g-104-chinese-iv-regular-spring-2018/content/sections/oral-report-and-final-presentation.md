Oral Report Guidelines 第一次口头报吿/第一次口頭報告: 我最喜欢的故事/我最喜歡的故事 (gùshì: story)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*   **Method of Report**

1.  Your report should be about 3 to 4 minutes long.
2.  You are to stand in front of the class. You may quickly look at your notes, but don’t be tied to them.
3.  You can use PowerPoint slides or bring any visual aids as you see fit.

When you prepare, besides _accuracy_ and _fluency_ that you have been working on along the way, be sure to pay attention to _coherence_ of your discourse (e.g. Is your language logical and consistent by using appropriate connection words?). Also, try to incorporate a few new sentence patterns from Unit 16 and Unit 17 into your report.

*   **Roles of Audience**

One of the purposes of oral reports is to learn how to use Chinese to elaborate your thoughts and engage in meaningful conversations with your classmates. Listeners will be required to ask the presenter one or two questions at the end. Your participation is expected and will be evaluated.

*   **Grading Rubric**

| Pronunciation and Tones | 30% |
| Grammar and Structures | 30% |
| Content and Discourse | 30% |
| Participation | 10% 

*   **A Useful Online Dictionary**

[Online Chinese-English Talking Dictionary](https://www.yellowbridge.com/chinese/)
