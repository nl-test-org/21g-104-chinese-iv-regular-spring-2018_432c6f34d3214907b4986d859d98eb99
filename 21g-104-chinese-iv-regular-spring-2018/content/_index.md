Together with [21G.103 Chinese III](/courses/21g-103-chinese-iii-regular-fall-2018/), this course forms the intermediate level of what constitutes a four-term foundation in Mandarin. Upon completion of Chinese III and IV, students should be able to speak Chinese with fluency on everyday topics, reach a literacy level of 750 characters (approximately 1200 common words written in both traditional and simplified characters), read materials written in simple standard written Chinese, and produce both orally and in writing short compositions on everyday topics. Throughout the course we will address issues of how cultural differences inform and are informed by different linguistic contexts and practices.
